Building the Decentralized Future.</h1></header><main><section id="about"><h2>About Us</h2><p>Pigeon Flix aims to bring the power of <strong>Web3</strong> technology directly to your home cinema. Imagine a world where anyone can launch decentralized communities and distribute content without relying on a centralized infrastructure like the tech giants (GAFA).</p><p><strong>FLIXINFO</strong> is the key tool that makes this a reality. It's a robust torrent client that supports a wide range of protocols, including <strong>magnet links</strong>, <strong>M3U links</strong>, <strong>RSS feeds</strong>, and more, as well as connections to seedboxes via ruTorrent, SFTP, FTP, and FTPS. Beyond that, it's also a media player that automatically launches videos for seamless viewing.</p><p>You might be wondering why we support seedboxes via the ruTorrent protocol when we already have a built-in torrent client. The reason is simple: it lets people join your community with a single click and no hassle. The bigger your community grows and the more people who help by hosting seedboxes—either at home or in data centers—the more robust and resistant your videos are to any form of censorship.</p><p>What makes <strong>FLIXINFO</strong> truly revolutionary is its ability to connect you to <strong>Web3 communities</strong>. By using an <strong>Ethereum Name Service (ENS) .eth domain</strong>, you can directly access a configuration file in <strong>JSON format</strong> hosted on <strong>IPFS</strong> (InterPlanetary File System).</p><p>This allows you to distribute <strong>SQLite databases</strong> containing your content and categories, or you can store all your videos, magnet links, and descriptions in separate <strong>JSON files</strong>. You no longer need solutions like OnlyFans or YouTube to create and launch your community.</p><p>Flix has a roadmap to write an independent <strong>SDK</strong> using the <strong>SimpleX Chat</strong> protocol. This will allow it to directly integrate communities with chat bots in a completely decentralized way. In the long run, there will be no need to go through IPFS to download the JSON config file. The chat bot will be able to respond directly to all of the user's needs. Thanks to the SimpleX Chat protocol, Flix will be able to create completely decentralized communities with all the real-time functionalities.</p><p>This allows you to distribute <strong>SQLite databases</strong> containing your content and categories, or you can store all your videos, magnet links, and descriptions in separate <strong>JSON files</strong>. You no longer need solutions like OnlyFans or YouTube to create and launch your community.</p><p>From there, content creators can define their own databases, access models, and payment systems using <strong>cryptocurrency</strong> to offer videos distributed via the <strong>BitTorrent protocol</strong>. This allows any creator to rely on a reliable, decentralized technology without spending millions on hosting fees or being forced to use the infrastructure of a GAFA company.</p><p><strong><u>It's important to note that FLIXINFO does not provide any content. We are simply the technological tool that marries all these disparate technologies. You could say we are the "philosopher's stone" of Web3.</u></strong></p></section><section id="comic-strip"><h2>The Story of Our Pigeon Flix Family</h2><p class="comic-intro"><p>Since ancient times, the <strong>Flix family</strong> has braved countless dangers to deliver messages of love and faced armies since ancient Greece to carry urgent requests for military reinforcements. The Flix family survived the Crusades and World War II, always serving as vital messengers.</p><p><strong>Flix the pigeon</strong> was fortunate enough to study at the world's best universities, where he met the most brilliant minds on the planet. With his small paws, he decided to continue the family tradition and code this completely crazy project in the world of <strong>Web3</strong>.</p><p>In a world linking <strong>robust protocols</strong> like BitTorrent with <strong>modern protocols</strong> such as ENS (Ethereum Name Service) and IPFS, Flix brings a new era of decentralized communication.</p></p><div class="comic-container"><picture><source srcset="pics/bd1.avif" type="image/avif"><source srcset="pics/bd1.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="pics/bd1.jpg" alt="Comic Strip Page 1" class="comic-panel"></picture><picture><source srcset="pics/bd2.avif" type="image/avif"><source srcset="pics/bd2.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="pics/bd2.jpg" alt="Comic Strip Page 2" class="comic-panel"></picture><picture><source srcset="pics/bd3.avif" type="image/avif"><source srcset="pics/bd3.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="pics/bd3.jpg" alt="Comic Strip Page 3" class="comic-panel"></picture><picture><source srcset="pics/bd4.avif" type="image/avif"><source srcset="pics/bd4.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="pics/bd4.jpg" alt="Comic Strip Page 4" class="comic-panel"></picture></div><p class="comic-outro">
